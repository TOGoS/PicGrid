== New gridification method ==

For a given set of images with weights (these weights can
be assigned arbitrarily), create a single row.
Find the average area / weight.
Create the row again, this time adjusting images that are
too large by attempting to fit them into a cell with
neighboring images that are also too large.

Next, take the width/height of the single row
and calculate how many rows the image set should be split into
to match the target ratio.  Break the single row up into
that many rows, that many -1, -2, +1, and +2, and
hold onto those configurations and their fitness values.

Repeat the 2 steps but making columns instead of rows.

== Flexibility ==

Break program into smaller parts that can be run separately.

Include a utility for scanning emitted HTML files for URNs
and writing them all to STDOUT.
